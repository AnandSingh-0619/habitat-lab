Mostly Hello Stretch infrastructure

## Installation

1. Prepare a conda environment
1. Install repo `pip install -e .`
1. (optional) Install Mamba: `conda install -c conda-forge mamba`


## Code Contribution

We enforce linters for our code. The `formatting` test will not pass if your code does not conform.

To make this easy for yourself, you can either
- Add the formattings to your IDE
- Install the git [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks by running
    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install
    ```

To enforce this in VSCode, install [black](https://github.com/psf/black), [set your Python formatter to black](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_formatting) and [set Format On Save to true](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_6#_format-on-save).

To format manually, run: `black .`
